An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides tools for looking up Elm package documentation. This server allows AI assistants to read elm.json files and fetch package documentation from the official Elm package repository.

## Features

- **List Elm Packages**: List all direct and indirect Elm language dependencies from elm.json
- **Fetch Elm Package README**: Get the README content for any Elm package by specifying author, name, and version
- **Fetch Elm Package Documentation**: Get the full API documentation for any Elm package by specifying author, name, and version, including:
  - Module documentation
  - Type definitions (unions and aliases)
  - Function signatures and documentation
  - Binary operators

## Installation

### Building from Source

1. Make sure you have Rust installed (https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Build the binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/elm-package-mcp-server`

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Go to Developer â†’ Edit Config
3. Add the following to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "elm-package": {
      "command": "/path/to/elm-package-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/elm-package-mcp-server` with the actual path to your built binary.

### Zed

- Open the Assistant Panel (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd>)
- Click "Add Custom Server..."
- Enter the following in the window that appears:

```json
{
  "elm-package": {
    "command": "/path/to/elm-package-mcp-server",
    "args": ["--mcp"],
    "env": {}
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/elm-package-mcp-server` with the actual path to your built binary.

## Usage

The server must be run from a directory containing an elm.json file or any subdirectory of an Elm project. It will automatically find the elm.json file by searching up the directory tree.

### Available Tools

The server provides three tools for working with Elm packages. All tools are prefixed with `elm` to help with discoverability when working with Elm language projects.

#### list_elm_packages
Lists all Elm packages from elm.json file. This tool discovers available Elm language dependencies in your project.

Parameters:
- `include_indirect` (optional, boolean): Include indirect dependencies (default: false)

Example response:
```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "author": "elm",
      "name": "core",
      "version": "1.0.5",
      "type": "direct"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "direct_count": 1,
  "indirect_count": 0
}
```

#### get_elm_package_readme
Fetches the README documentation for a specific Elm language package from package.elm-lang.org.

Parameters:
- `author` (required, string): Package author (e.g., "elm")
- `name` (required, string): Package name (e.g., "core")
- `version` (required, string): Package version (e.g., "1.0.5")

#### get_elm_package_docs
Fetches the API documentation for a specific Elm language package from package.elm-lang.org.

Parameters:
- `author` (required, string): Package author (e.g., "elm")
- `name` (required, string): Package name (e.g., "core")
- `version` (required, string): Package version (e.g., "1.0.5")
- `module` (optional, string): Filter to a specific module

Example response includes:
- Module names and documentation
- Type definitions (unions and aliases)
- Function signatures with types and documentation
- Binary operators with precedence and associativity

### Workflow Example

1. First, use `list_elm_packages` to discover available packages:
   - This returns all packages with their authors, names, and versions
2. Then, use the returned information to fetch documentation:
   - Call `get_elm_package_readme` with author, name, and version
   - Call `get_elm_package_docs` with author, name, and version (and optionally a module name)

### Available Resources

#### elm://elm.json
The project's elm.json file, accessible as a resource.

## CLI Options

- `--mcp`: Run as an MCP server for Elm package documentation
- `--tools`: Display available Elm package tools
- `--resources`: Display available resources
- `--prompts`: Display available prompts
- `--json`: Output information in JSON format

## Development

This server is built using:
- [rpc-router](https://github.com/jeremychone/rust-rpc-router/) for JSON-RPC routing
- [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) for HTTP requests
- [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) for CLI argument parsing

## Future Plans

This MCP server is designed to be shipped with a Zed extension, which will be developed in the same repository.
